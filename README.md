## Data Science Project Guidelines, Version 2.0.43

##### Data science projects require structure.  In essence, you are solving data problems by applying the scientific method.  The following guidelines have been refined with over 2,000 data science students, and is a continuous iteration for building capstone projects for your data science or data engineering portfolio.  If you would like to contribute to the material, you are welcome to share across your considerations, and offer these guidelines with attribution to your colleagues as well.

##### These guidelines are focused for the Python developer ecosystem.  If you are interested in additional resources, consider some of the following links to explore such as the [distinctions between Python and R](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-machine-learning-in-Python-and-R).  There is a broad scope of resources to learn in Python including these [cheatsheets](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat/tree/master/cheat/cheatsheets) for common integrations with the Python language.  I am confident that with these resources below, your journey will be fruitful for your learning and career.

### Part One

<details>
  <summary><strong>Proposal Requirements :notebook:</strong></summary>

> It is recommended to create several ideas (3 to 5) each on a PowerPoint slide that includes the following components below, to facilitate the scoping of your data science project.  When considering for a project to create, start here on [how to ask Data Science questions](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-ask-questions-data-science-can-solve-e073d6a06236) or [asking insightful questions](https://amplitude.com/blog/2015/07/01/question-the-data-how-to-ask-the-right-questions-to-get-actionable-insights).
> After you have identified the project you will work on, then create a markdown (.md) file on Github using the same structure more in-depth, such as an Abstract/Thesis for your project (ideally 300-600 words).  [This is a markdown reference guide.](https://youtu.be/V0fZkWDkPLA)

These criteria are strongly encouraged in scoping out your project: 

> 1. Project Name: What is the Title for your project 
> 2. Problem Statement: What are you trying to solve? (High-level overarching problem to be explored)
> 2. Data science Hypothesis(es)/solutions considering: One or multiple angles to consider solving this problem with data science.  This could be as many as 10+ questions for what you are considering to solve through analysis, visualizations, and machine learning 
> 3. Data sets to be used: Share the links and files, .csvs, .js, .xlsx, .txt, website URLs.  If you are usng web scraping or APIs, note the appropriate links and strategies here as well. Also describe how large are your data files and if you are concerned on any shortcomings of your data.
> 4. Data dictionaries to describe the data types you're using: write these out in markdown as tables  
> 5. Potential business cases relative to project: how would this help businesses out to make money or save money or improve accuracy or make better products
> 6. Potential stakeholders who would find this interesting: who would be your ideal customer or client for this?
> 7. Potential places to share your results post project (client, world, website, blog)

> This information can be presented in a PowerPoint presentation.  Consider applying the **SMART** Framework as well as Data Science Methodology to structure for projects with Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reproducible, and Time-bound goals.  Describe how you will **Frame, Prepare, Analyze, Interpret, and Communicate** your data science challenge.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Deliverables:**
> 1. To be pushed to github
> 2. To be submitted as a markdown readme.md file in your project-final repository

  <summary><strong>EDA Guidelines :bar_chart:</strong></summary>
  
> 0. Creating a capstone project can result in stress levels on your machine that cause slow processing power. If you are interested to measure your results consider [timing processing](http://pynash.org/2013/03/06/timing-and-profiling/).  In order to accelerate your prototyping during the development phase, you can consider a cloud solution offering such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [importing data into Google Colab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46986398/import-data-into-google-colaboratory), [Microsoft Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) and [IBM Notebooks](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/notebooks-parent.html).  If you are looking for more advanced infrastructure, consider providers such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp), and [IBM Watson Data Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio).  If you are looking for instant container solutions for data science projects, consider [Crestle](https://www.crestle.com/) and [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)
> 1. To start, please be sure to create Notebooks that you code your data analysis in.  You will want to work in a Python 3 environment. You can also [customize your Jupyter environment](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator) including [adding themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes). If you have legacy python 2 code, a [converter](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_prettify/README_2to3.html) does exist.  These notebooks should be through the Jupyter framework, which support .ipynb (iPython Notebooks) and .md (Markdown) files, as well as interactivity between both, which can be displayed effectively through a Github environment or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). If you would like, you can do additional editing through [VSCode](https://vscodecandothat.com/) and even set it as your [default editor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30024353/how-to-use-visual-studio-code-as-default-editor-for-git).  Practing [Jupyter shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) may facilitate your efficiency with the Notebook environment.
> 2. Import your data or [multiple data files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20906474/import-multiple-csv-files-into-pandas-and-concatenate-into-one-dataframe) and to save as dataframes, and convert [XML to DataFrames](http://www.austintaylor.io/lxml/python/pandas/xml/dataframe/2016/07/08/convert-xml-to-pandas-dataframe/) when needed.  And [unzip files](https://chrisjean.com/unzip-multiple-files-from-linux-command-line/) easily.
> 3. Examine your data, columns and rows and rename and adjust indexing and encoding as appropriate. This [Pandas Cheatsheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) could be resourcesful for you.  Did you also know that Python has excellent [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).
> 4. Clean null and blank values, and consider to drop rows, as well as to manipulate data and adjust data types as appropriate, including [dates](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.11-working-with-time-series.html) and [time](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html), or setting appropriate indices. Adjusting specific values and replacing strings and characters for the data wrangling process.  
> 5. Explore analysis with graphing and visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn and alternative visualization packages ([Plot.ly and Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Vincent](https://vincent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Mlpd3](http://mpld3.github.io/index.html) [pygal](http://pygal.org/en/stable/)).  It is important to create [reproducible graphs](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2016/04/13/reproducible-plots/). [Sci-kit plot](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot) may help.  Additional Seaborn resources may be helpful: ([Cat graphs](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.catplot.html), [Seaborn Color Palettes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html), [Matplotlib Color Maps](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html) and [more Seaborn examples](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/)).  You can also explore [advanced Matplotlib capabilities](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/ch04.html), [legends with Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html) and [Matplotlib styles](https://tonysyu.github.io/raw_content/matplotlib-style-gallery/gallery.html). [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/explore/?filter=most-popular&time=month) also offers fantastic color selections. Numerous [magic methods](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) exist to allow graphs to display and to offer [customized magical functions](https://github.com/RafeKettler/magicmethods/blob/master/magicmethods.pdf).
> 6. Perform additional analysis by creating new columns for calculations, including aggregator functions, counts and groupbys. [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) could be helpful for statistical calculations as well.  Consider what [distributions](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html) you might be working with and [all the possibilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions).
> 7. Encode categorical variables with a variety of techniques through logical conditions, mapping, applying, where clauses, dummy variables, and one hot encoding. Here is [one method to encodage categorical variables](http://benalexkeen.com/mapping-categorical-data-in-pandas/) in Pandas.  When displaying results, consider to [format](https://pyformat.info/) them as well including as [floats](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6149006/display-a-float-with-two-decimal-places-in-python/6149115).
> 8. Re-run calculations, including crosstabs or pivots, and new graphs to see results 
> 9. Create correlation matrices, [pairplots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html), scatterplot matrices, and [heatmaps](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) to determine which attributes should be features for your models and which attributes should not.  Design your visualizations with themes such as [pallettes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html). 
> 10. Identify the response variables(s) that you would want to predict/classify/interpret with data science 
> 11. Perform additional feature engineering as necessary, including Min/Max, Normalizaton, Scaling, and additional Pipeline changes that may be beneficial or helpful when you run machine learning.  If you have trouble installing packages, this [environmental variable resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31615322/zsh-conda-pip-installs-command-not-found) may be helpful.
> 12. Merge or concatenate datasets with [Pandas merging](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html), or SQL methods (I.e., [Learning SQL](https://www.quora.com/What-some-of-the-websites-where-I-can-practice-Advance-SQL), [SQL Joins](http://sqlhints.com/tag/cross-join/), [Joins #2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38549/what-is-the-difference-between-inner-join-and-outer-join), [Joins #3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17759687/cross-join-vs-inner-join-in-sql-server-2008), [SQL Tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/), and [Saving Queries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31769736/saving-sql-queries-as-sql-text-file) if you have not already, based on common keys or unique items for more in-depth analysis 
> 13. Add commenting and markdown throughout the jupyter notebook to explain the interpretation of your results or to comment on code that may not be human readable, and help you recall for you what you are referencing. (Markdown references: [Latex Cheatsheet](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/beber/files/Chang_LaTeX_sheet.pdf), [Markdown for Jupyter Notebooks](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed), [LaTeX in Notebooks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13208286/how-to-write-latex-in-ipython-notebook), [Markdown Intro](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html), [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), 
> 14. To create a markdown .md milestone report that shows and explains the results of what you have accomplished to date in this part of your course project. Consider also creating a .pdf or .pptx to display initial results, aha moments, or findings that would be novel or fascinating for your final presentations.

### Part Three
<details>
  <summary><strong>Machine Learning Guidelines :computer:</strong></summary>
  
> 0. Create a brand new Jupyter notebook, where you run the latest DataFrame or .csv files(s) that you have previously saved from your exploratory data analysis notebook. 
> 1. After you have completed the exploratory data analysis section of your project, start revisiting your hypothesis(es) on ideas that you would like to either predict (regression) or classify (classifier).  > 2. Have you identified a specific column or multiple columns that could be treated as response or target variables to predict/classify?
> 3. If not, consider performing additional exploratory analysis that helps you pinpoint a potential working hypothesis to test results against. You could consider clustering as an addition to exploratory data analysis as a preparation for machine learning.
> 4. Consider for your machine learning what parts of your feature engineering have been completed, or need to additionally be completed through [Pre-processing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing) and its [use cases](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) or [Pipeline](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html#sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline) operations such as [Normalize](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Normalizer.html), Scaler, Min/Max, etc. 
> 5. As a result of correlation matrices, heatmaps, and visualizations, consider which features may be relevant to support the model that you are building. 
> 6. Consider what machine learning models through [SkLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_downloads/scikit-learn-docs.pdf) and their [Github Repo](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) or [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) could be effective for your newly discovered [hypothesis testing](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/11/python-for-data-analysis-part-24.html?view=classic) (linear regressions (I.e., [Lowess Regression](http://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess.lowess.html), [Logistic regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) and [multi-class models](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html), KNearest Neighbors, [Clustering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html), [Decision Trees](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) including [Bagging Regressor](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingRegressor.html) or the [Bagging Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html), and [feature selection for Ensembles](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_feature_transformation.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-ensemble-plot-feature-transformation-py), Random Forest including [Tuning RF](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-the-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-28d2aa77dd74), Naive Bayes, Natural Language Processing ([Word2Vec](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/word2vec-translation), [Spacy](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/spaCy-tutorial) and [Spacy Models](https://spacy.io/usage/models), and [Topic Modeling](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/topic-modeling)) Time Series Analysis (I.e., [Time Series 1](https://machinelearningmastery.com/convert-time-series-supervised-learning-problem-python/) and [Time Series 2](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-supervised-learning/), [Neural Networks](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html), Support Vector Machines and [Model Resistance](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html), [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://www.scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html), dimensionality reduction with PCA as well as Ensembles such as [GB Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html) and [GB Regressor](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html)).  Once you have determined models to consider, be sure to import their packages into Python.
> 7. Consider what tuning parameters you may want to optimize for your model, including regularization (Lasso, ridge, ElasticNet), and additional parameters relevant to each model.  [Github Code Search](http://jakubdziworski.github.io/tools/2016/08/26/github-code-advances-search-programmers-goldmine.html) could help you as you are adjusting your models.
> 8.  Be sure to include a train_test_split, and then consider a KFolds or Cross Validations to offer stratified results that limit the interpretation of outliers for your dataset.
> 9. If you still have many outliers, consider how to remove them or optimize for them with categories.  How could you adjust your categories, or thresholds to improve performance for what you are testing for your hypothesis? Depending on how your model error performs, you may want to consider to change or adjust other features in your model.  You may want to consider to add or remove features, and measure the feature importance when running models. 
> 10.  Consider a [Grid Search](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html), [Grid Search with Cross Validation Continued](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_grid_search_digits.html), or [Random Search](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html) to better optimize your models. 
> 11.  Share metrics on each model that is run, such as error and accuracy, confusion matrices which are based off [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table), and [logical conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity). They can be displayed through [ROC/AUC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html) curves as well as [visually](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-confusion-matrix-py). [Scoring your models](http://benalexkeen.com/scoring-classifier-models-using-scikit-learn/) is important for both regression and classification techniques.  Other models have additional metrics, that you can consider to share.  You can set up metrics and running models in defined functions for further automation of your project. 
> 12. Compare your metrics against the base case or null case for accuracy, which ideally is compared to your majority class, or a median/mean representation for your target/response variable.  How well does your model perform?
> 13. Provide markdown explaining the interpretation relevant to your business case after running models.  Also, share comments to explain what you are doing, for your interpretation and then reproducibility of your code. 
> 14.  If you are running Time Series Analysis, you will want to consider additional model capabilities such as rolling and moving averages with the dateTime package and pandas.
> 15.  If you are working on Natural Language processing, you will want to consider python packages such as [Spacy](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/spaCy-tutorial), [topic modeling](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/topic-modeling),  NLTK, TextBlob, and [word2vec](https://github.com/davidyakobovitch/word2vec-translation).
> 16. If you are scraping additional data, consider python packages such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup4.
> 17.  For your project, your presentation will showcase the best 3-5 models.  However, it is fine if you have inefficient models that do not perform well, for practice, so keep these in your main modeling Jupyter notebook as a reference. 
> 18. If you chose to work with .py scripts, here is a [method to rename these files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2759067/rename-multiple-files-in-a-directory-in-python/24954254).
